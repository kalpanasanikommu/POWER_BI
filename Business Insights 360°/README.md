AtliQ Technologies, a rapidly growing consumer electronics company (which sells PCs, keyboards, etc.), needed to transition from a heavy excel dependency to a dynamic business intelligence (BI) tool like Power BI to analyze their data more efficiently.

This shift was crucial as their reliance on excel was leading to significant financial losses, limiting insights and slowing data-driven decisions.

Using Power BI, I have developed an interactive business report featuring six distinct, comprehensive views.
**Project Execution**

This project involves several steps:

🔸Connecting MySQL database to Power BI.

🔸Validating and transforming data carefully.

🔸Adding calculated columns for better analysis.

🔸Using strong data modeling methods.

🔸Building interactive dashboards.

🔸Regularly checking data and incorporating stakeholder feedback for ongoing improvements.

**Building Dashboard :**
