**Domain:**  Hospitality 

**Function:** Revenue

**Problem Statement:**

AtliQ Grands owns multiple five-star hotels across India. They have been in the hospitality industry for the past 20 years. Due to strategic moves from other competitors and ineffective decision-making in management, AtliQ Grands are losing its market share and revenue in the luxury/business hotels category. As a strategic move, the managing director of AtliQ Grands wanted to incorporate “Business and Data Intelligence” to regain their market share and revenue. However, they do not have an in-house data analytics team to provide them with these insights.

Their revenue management team had decided to hire a 3rd party service provider to provide them with insights from their historical data.

**Task:** 


🎯Create the metrics according to the metric list.

🎯Create a dashboard according to the mock-up provided by stakeholders.

🎯Create relevant insights that are not provided in the metric list/mock-up dashboard.**
